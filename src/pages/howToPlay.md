### What is Puzzle Alley?

Puzzle Alley is a unique game that combines puzzles, digital collectibles, and a scavenger hunt.

<br /><br />
### How does it work?

Find an official Puzzle Alley QR code at JPIC. Scan it to start the hunt! When you hover over the QR code with your phone's camera app, a special link will appear.
When you scan the QR, you will be prompted to make a Blocto Wallet to store the unique data on your pieces. Creating a wallet is easy and only needs a valid email address; no personal information is necessary!
After you make your Blocto Wallet, a token of your puzzle piece will be 'minted' on the blockchain, and your digital puzzle piece will be added to your unique Collection.
Find more puzzle pieces! Every time you find a piece, claim it, mint it, and it will be added to your wallet!
When you complete the puzzle, please bring your mobile device to the Rose Cat Khan booth. The first 100 hunters will get a limited edition signed art print from puzzle illustrator Rose Catherine Khan.

### Why and what is an NFT?

An NFT is a digital collectible. The term stands for Non-Fungible Token; it basically means that the digital piece you collect has a unique identifying code. In the future, your puzzles can be traded with other collectors of Puzzle Alley, displayed in a virtual gallery, or used for games. JPIC is our inaugural convention
