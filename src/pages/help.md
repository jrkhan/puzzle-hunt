##### Help! Something isn't working!

Weâ€™re sorry if a bug spoiled your gameplay of Puzzle Alley.  Puzzle Alley is still in beta testing, so your feedback is appreciated so we can catch those pesky little critters and turn them into butterflies.

[Contact us](mailto:bugreport@puzzlealley.com) with a description of your error, with screenshots if possible.

You can also stop by the Rose Cat Khan booth for in-person help. Just ask for Jamil, he's our tech expert!

If you're stressed the app isn't working right, don't worry, all participants in Puzzle Alley at JPIC are still eligible for a prize. :-)
